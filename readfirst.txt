* Why use pipenv (virtual environment)? 

"Some times you are not given root privileges and you might end up not being able to use sudo(https://namu.wiki/w/sudo). Many other times, it's not advisable to use sudo to install packages 

as it might overwrite some package which might be in use by some other applications.

Virtualenv can help you create a separate environment where you don't need root privileges as well as be able to tailor the environment according to your need. 

It consists of self-contained python installation which only interacts with your specific created environment.

So basically, it gives you a bit of freedom as well as avoid damaging (or modifying) the root environment which might be hosting many old functionalities of old applications.

Installation is pretty easy too." - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41972261/what-is-a-virtualenv-and-why-should-i-use-one
